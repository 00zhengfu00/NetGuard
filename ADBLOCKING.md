Ad blocking
-----------

* Download/install the latest version [from GitHub](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/releases)
* Enable the setting '*Filter traffic*'
* Enable the setting '*Block domain names*'
* Import or download a hosts file using the appropriate option
* Wait 10 minutes to let the Android DNS cache time out
* Enjoy ad blocking

You can check the number of hosts (domains) imported by pulling the NetGuard notification down using two fingers.

NetGuard provides the [StevenBlack hosts file](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) download with the following additions:

* reports.crashlytics.com
* settings.crashlytics.com
* e.crashlytics.com

See [here](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/issues/277) for alternative hosts files.

**Note that ad blocking is not available when NetGuard was installed from the Play store!**
